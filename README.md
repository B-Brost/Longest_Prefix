# Longest_Prefix

This Python program contains a class named Solution with two methods: longestCommonPrefix and longest. Both methods are designed to find the longest common prefix among a list of strings.

longestCommonPrefix(strs): This method iteratively compares the characters of the strings in the list. It starts from the first character and continues to the next characters if they are the same across all strings. The process stops when a mismatch is found or one of the strings is exhausted. It returns the longest common prefix found.
longest(strs): This method sorts the list of strings first. It then compares the first and the last string in the sorted list, character by character, until a mismatch is found. It returns the longest common prefix between the first and last string.
These methods provide efficient ways to find the longest common prefix in a list of strings, which can be useful in various applications such as autocomplete features, DNA sequence alignment, and more. Please note that both methods return an empty string if the input list is empty or no common prefix is found.
